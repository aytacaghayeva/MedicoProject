                health care in
                poor, rural communities in Central America where such care is extremely limited or not available. We
                sponsor clinical teams consisting of international and local medical, dental and vision care providers,
                nurses, and lay volunteers to operate temporary field clinics. MEDICO promotes public health by
                providing community health education and by sponsoring professional training of local providers. We
                organize and fund community improvements including the repair, renovation or building of village
                clinics, water systems and schools. MEDICO is an independent non-profit organization made up almost
                entirely of volunteers. We are not affiliated or allied with any political group or religious
                organization.</p>

                    volunteer work in the
                    United States to treating patients in a remote village in Honduras. Our volunteers help organize and
                    teach classes, and they work out the logistics of building clinics and schools. Equally vital are
                    our donors who support MEDICO's mission efforts in Central America. It takes a team to make our work
                    happen.</p>

                <p class="where">MEDICO’s current programs are centered in Honduras. We have worked in Honduras for over
                    30 years. The
                    population of Honduras is approximately 10 million, of which nearly 15% of the people live on less
                    than US $1.90 a day. While the Honduran health care system is staffed for the most part by
                    competent, caring and compassionate professionals, they are simply overwhelmed by the need,
                    especially in rural areas. In comparison, even the smallest fee takes medical, dental or vision care
                    out of reach of most people. In the more remote areas of the country, such as Gracias a Dios in the
                    east, there are no roads, so even transport to medical care is impossible, even if such care
                    existed. MEDICO works directly with communities. Our assessment teams along with the Ministry of
                    Health locate communities where the need is most critical. We select communities able and willing to
                    work collaboratively with us. What do they need? How can we help? What can we do together? This is
                    often a MEDICO/Honduran medical-dental-vision care team. It might be community classes on family
                    planning, nutrition, or sanitation. It might be repairs or upgrades to their clinic or their school
                    or the community water system.</p>

                <p>"An established organization with a long history of service in communities in dire need of support,
                    MEDICO Teams have become the highlight of my year. Over the years I have met so many amazing
                    selfless volunteers and formed friendships and bonds that will last a lifetime.</p>
                <p>I am constantly humbled by the outpouring of hospitality and kindness shown to us by the Honduran
                    people and inspired by their sense of community and culture. Never short in demand, the Medical and
                    Dental teams have been missed through the COVID epidemic and are needed now more than ever, and I am
                    excited for the opportunity to serve as part of this amazing team."
